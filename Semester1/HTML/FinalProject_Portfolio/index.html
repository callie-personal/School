            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Hi, my name is Callie Pretty and I'm currently a student at NSCC IT Campus in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  I've always
              loved math and have started to channel that into a love for programming.  That feeling you get when you finallly
              solve a problem is indescribable.  I've been learning Javascript, HTML as well as Networking
              and Database Management.  My goal is to combine my past training in art & animation with
              the new knowledge of programming that I'm pursuing.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I'm not at home learning to code, you can usually find me outside with my beloved dog, spending time 
              with family or reading a book on our deck.
            </p>

            <p>
              I look forward to meeting new people in the industry!
            </p>
