# PROG1700 In-class exercise 9- Sorting Hat
## Make sure you make multiple commits
> We all know that the Hogwarts’ Sorting Hat cheats. If your last name is “Potter”, you will wind up in Gryffindor and if your last name is “Malfoy” you will be assigned to Slytherin. For the rest of the students, we will generate one of four random numbers. If the first number, it will assign them to Gryffindor. If the second number, then they are assigned to Hufflepuff. If the third number, then they are assigned to Ravenclaw. If the fourth number, then they are assigned to Slytherin.
1.	Create a flowchart in LucidChart/Visio for this program (Note: This is the flowchart demonstrated in the video, if you need some guidance). [https://lucidchart.com/]
2.	Save the Flowchart as an image file (e.g. PNG file).
3.	Copy the image file you created in Step 5 into the folder you created in your repository in Step 2.
4.	Code a JavaScript file in the same in-class folder to implement the enhanced Hogwarts’ Sorting Hat. 
5.	MAKE SURE TO TEST ALL PATHS OF EXECUTION THROUGH THE PROGRAM.
