# PROG1700Ex6
Starter code for in class exercise 6
* Create a program called “Orange Orders” (orange_orders.js). The program will calculate the cost of a shipment of oranges from an online produce store. The program will ask the user to enter how many pounds of oranges they want and then, using a per pound cost of $1.99 and a flat shipping cost of $7.50 will calculate and display the final cost of the oranges. If the user orders at least 100 pounds, then the shipping cost is reduced by $1.50.
* Write Pseudocode for the program first and save it as a separate text file in the same folder (orange_order_pcode.txt).
* Code a solution to the program. Try to put the least amount of code in the if statement as possible.
* Test the code by running it ?????? times to make sure it works. (Document the changes)
* Ask the instructor for help if stuck.
* Figure out how many times you need to run the code to make sure the code is working.
*	Make sure that all the work as successfully committed and pushed to GitHub.
*	Submit the final commit ID on BrightSpace
